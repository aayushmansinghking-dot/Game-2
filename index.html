<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Rani_of_Jhansi.jpg" class="right">
<p>
Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi stands among the greatest national treasures of India. Her life represents extraordinary courage, resistance, leadership, and sacrifice at a time when colonial oppression threatened India’s identity. She was not merely a queen defending her kingdom; she was a revolutionary who challenged the British Empire with unmatched bravery. Her story is not only about war but also about dignity, justice, and the unbreakable spirit of Indian womanhood.
</p>
<p>
Born in the early nineteenth century, Rani Lakshmibai grew up in an India where political power was shifting rapidly into British hands. Despite social restrictions on women, she rose as a warrior-leader, administrator, and symbol of national pride. Her role in the Revolt of 1857 immortalized her in Indian history.

<h2>Birth, Childhood, and Early Environment</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Manikarnika_Tambe.jpg" class="left">
<p>
Rani Lakshmibai was born on 19 November 1828 in Varanasi. Her birth name was Manikarnika Tambe, affectionately called Manu. She belonged to a Marathi Brahmin family. Her childhood was marked by freedom, discipline, and exposure to politics due to her father’s association with the Peshwa’s court.
</p>
<p>
Unlike girls of her time, Manu was encouraged to develop physical strength and intellectual curiosity. She learned horse riding, sword fighting, archery, and wrestling. These early experiences laid the foundation for her fearless personality and future leadership.

<h2>Family Details</h2>

<h3>Father – Moropant Tambe</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Moropant_Tambe.jpg" class="right">
<p>
Moropant Tambe was a progressive thinker and court official of Peshwa Baji Rao II. He believed in equality, courage, and education. After the early death of Manu’s mother, he raised her himself and ensured she received both academic and military training.
</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<h3>Mother – Bhagirathi Sapre</h3>
<p>
Bhagirathi Sapre passed away when Manikarnika was very young. Though her time with her daughter was brief, her cultural values and moral teachings deeply influenced the queen’s character.
</p>

<h3>Husband – Maharaja Gangadhar Rao</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Gangadhar_Rao.jpg" class="left">
<p>
In 1842, Manikarnika married Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar of Jhansi. She was renamed Lakshmibai. As queen, she actively participated in governance and gained the trust of her people.
</p>

<h3>Son – Damodar Rao (Adopted)</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Damodar_Rao.jpg" class="right">
<p>
After losing her biological son, the royal couple adopted Damodar Rao. The British refusal to accept him as heir under the Doctrine of Lapse became the root cause of the Jhansi conflict.
</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<h3>Teachers and Training</h3>
<p>
Rani Lakshmibai was trained by expert warriors and scholars from the Peshwa’s court. Her education included literature, philosophy, statecraft, and advanced warfare techniques.
